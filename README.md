# Quiz Management Application

This is a basic quiz management application that allows users to create and edit quizzes. The application is built using React and stores quiz data in the component's state.

## How to Use

- When you launch the application, you will see a list of quizzes on the left side and a form for creating/editing quizzes on the right side.

- To create a new quiz, fill in the title, description, and questions, and click "Add Question" to add questions to the quiz. You can also add answers for each question. When you're done, click "Save Quiz" to save it.

- To edit an existing quiz, click on the quiz in the list, and its details will appear in the form. You can make changes and save the edited quiz.

## Local Storage

The application has local storage functionality, so your quiz data will be saved in your browser's local storage. This means you can close and reopen the application, and your quiz data will still be available.
